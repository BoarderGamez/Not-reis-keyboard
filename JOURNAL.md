## 10/17/2025 - Started on the keyboard (Almost) Finished the schematics  

So today I started on the schematic for my keyboard. Firstly I decided to make it 40% because, even with nvim it is a lot of work to press the number keys which is a waste of time. Which is why I decided on 40% with 8 modifier keys, 4 on each side. There are some other decisions I made for the keyboard:

- Split: To enhance my productivity and make it ergonomic and get no wrist pain
- Reversable PCB: To make the pcb cheaper to produce (only one pcb), so that I can spend more money on high quality parts and finish.
- Wired: To me wireless keyboards etc are a quite a hassle, charge them, turn them on and connecting bluetooth. Which is why I went for a wired keyboard as it is simple, plug it in, and it works.

I plan to add backlight and hotswap but I'm not at that point yet.
