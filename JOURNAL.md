## 10/17/2025 - Started on the keyboard (Almost) Finished the schematics  

So today I started on the schematic for my keyboard. Firstly I decided to make it 40% because, even with nvim it is a lot of work to press the number keys which is a waste of time. Which is why I decided on 40% with 8 modifier keys, 4 on each side. There are some other decisions I made for the keyboard:

- Split: To enhance my productivity and make it ergonomic and get no wrist pain
- Reversable PCB: To make the pcb cheaper to produce (only one pcb), so that I can spend more money on high quality parts and finish.
- Wired: To me wireless keyboards etc are a quite a hassle, charge them, turn them on and connecting bluetooth. Which is why I went for a wired keyboard as it is simple, plug it in, and it works.

I plan to add backlight and hotswap but I'm not at that point yet.

## 10/18/2025 - Perfected the layout  

So I was not feeling like working on the pcb, which is why I decided to finalise the layout of the keyboard. So, there were many decisions which I made to get to the current layout:

- Thumb cluster. In the schematics I already decided on 3 keys in the thumb cluster. (As if I put 4+ I wouldn't use all those keys.) But I had to figure out the placement of the thumb keys. So What I did is I went on youtube and looked at split keyboard thumb clusters. For the thumb cluster I decided to have something similar to the scotto keebs [ScottoFly](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/keyboards/scottofly-handwired-keyboard). 3 keys in thumb's reach. But I also saw a keyboard in a video from ajackster whith 2 2U keys in the thumb cluster, So I took that Idea and put it in the design. And in the end I got 2 1.5U Keys and a 1U key for the thumb cluster
- Pinky area. Unlike other fingers, pinkies are much more angled than other fingers, which is why I rotated the pinky keys by 10 degrees to reduce pinky strain.
- Macro keys. I decided to implement 4macro keys on the keyboard for efficiency. One near the index finger and 3 at the pinky. Macro keys are very versatile and are usefull for efficiency.
PS: It took 1h 20m because I went through many iterations and watched many youtube videos at the same time to find the optimal layout for my hand shape.
